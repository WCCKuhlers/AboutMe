<p>I was born and raised in Rockford, Iowa, which is a small rural community in North Central Iowa.
    My graduating class was 50 students.  I then attended the University of Iowa for five and a half
    years, but did get a BBA in Finance and minor in Marketing.  I worked as an accountant first for 
    Kinseth Hospitality, then for Oral-B Laboratories for 8 years.  I lived in North Liberty during 
    that time.  I was very active with Johnson County Juvenile Court and Youth for Christ mentoring
    teenage boys.  As an avid sports fan I used basketball and even baseball to create new opportunities
    for youth in the Iowa City/North Liberty area.  In my spare time I refereed basketball and umpired
    baseball - serving as the 13-15 year old baseball commissioner for the old Eastern Iowa Hawkeye 
    Conference. </p> 

    

<p> My second career took me into teaching high school, which is what I'm currently doing.  I have 
    taught at Alburnett High School, Union Community School District, and Waterloo Schools.  I currently
    teach at the Waterloo Career Center. </p>  

<p> I met me outstanding wife Jill Kuhlers in college, where she was my boss.  I was a tour guid in the 
    admissions office.  About the time I was switching careers we reconnected and eventaully got married. 
    We have two awesome boys; Travis is 32 years old and joined our family when he was 15 years old, a 
    freshman in high school.  Josh was born in 2006 and is now a teenager!

    We have a cat named Hadley and a turtle named Snappy. </p>
